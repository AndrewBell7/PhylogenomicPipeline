# PhylogenomicPipeline

Python code for performing a phylogenetic analysis.

## Briefly our code will:
- take .fasta files as input
- perform multiple sequence alignment
- perform phylogenetic analysis for each alignment
- tally the topologies of resulting gene trees
- create a figure summarizing results
